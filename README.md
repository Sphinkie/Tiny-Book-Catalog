# Tiny-Book-Catalog
Share your books with your friends (Android)

This projet includes:
- an Android application (created with App Inventor)
- a Web Service (developped with Python)

Description

With the Application, you scan the isbn barcodes of the books you want to share with your friends.
The App connects to the Web Service to collect the information and cover of the books.

Then, your friends can use the same application to see your book catalog and to send you a request for such or such book.
